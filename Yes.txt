Yes, exactly!

create-react-app (CRA) - is a tool that **quickly sets up a simple React application** with all the necessary configuration—so you don’t have to worry about Webpack, Babel, or other build tools.

It creates a basic, ready-to-run React project with:

* React and ReactDOM libraries
* A simple starting app (`App.js`)
* Development server with hot reload
* Build scripts to create production-ready code

So yes, CRA will create a simple React app for you, perfect to start learning or building on!



1. package.json	- The dependencies are in package.json and are added automatically from npm repository.

.render	  - pass HTML

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);



2. <App> - is a component, a function returns HTML+JS(JSX), (it's not a tag)

3. A page can have multiple components, and we can make each work independently.

4. index.html -> index.js -> App component [App.js]

5. import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
   ==




6. Boolean value cannot be displayed direct as true/false in browser screen

7. Cannot display Object direct on browser (Objects are not valid as a React
child)
function App() {
  const name = {age:30}
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <p>{name}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

'name' is an Object so wont work,
'name.age' will work


8. Math.random()   - generate random number between 0 - 1
   Math.floor(0.6) - 0, (1.4) - 1
   Math.ceil(0.6)  - 1, (1.4) - 2

9. Components name should be in capital letter

10. cltrl+r -> rafce (creates a React Arrow Function Component with ES7 module system) (add extension - ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets)

11. Ctrl + Shift + P → search and run Reload Window

12. Can export and import functions from other components to App components

13. What is a "function reference"?

A function reference is just a function that you *give* to something (like a button), so it can call it later, not immediately.

For example:

function sayHello() {
  alert("Hello!");
}

<button onClick={sayHello}>Click Me</button>

Here, `sayHello` is a *reference to the function*. It’s not being called right away. The browser will call it *when the button is clicked*.


Why is this a reference?

<button onClick={() => addItem("John")}>Add</button>

In this case, you're doing this:

onClick = () => addItem("John");

You are passing a **new function** (an arrow function) to `onClick`. That arrow function is just like any other function reference. It won’t run until the button is clicked.


### ✅ In summary:

* A **function reference** is just a function that you pass around to be called later.
* `() => addItem("John")` is an arrow function — you're creating it on the spot and passing it as a reference.
* React calls it **when the event happens**, not during render.
